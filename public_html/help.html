		<h3 id="slots">Fruit Bonanza</h3>

There you can click anywhere on the slot machine to test your luck. You can win by getting at least 2 symbols in a row starting from the left reel.</p>

		<h3 id="bj">BlackJack</h3>
		<p>If you would rather try and play some Blackjack then you can click the blackjack button and be redirected to the blackjack page. There you will be able to play a game of blackjack. To understand Blackjack you need to know that aces count as 11's, any face card is a 10, and all other cards have their face value. You will get 2 cards and be shown how many points you have. You will also be able to see one of the dealers cards. You then have 2 options, you can either hit or stay. If you hit you get another card, if you stay its then the dealers turn. The idea is for you to get as close to 21 as possible without going over. To win you have to have a hand that is higher points than the dealers without going over 21.</p>

		<h3 id="dragonTiger">Dragon Tiger</h3>
		<p>Blackjack might not be your card game. If not then B&L Games has Dragon Tiger! Here you can choose between either dragon or tiger and if the card you choose is higher than the other one, you win.</p>
